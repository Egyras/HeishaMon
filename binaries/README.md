This directory contains released and test versions for the HeishaMon software. 

The latest production release is v3.9. 

Make sure you use the correct firmware for your model. The 'small' version is for the HeishaMon PCB which has the ESP8266 chip. The 'large' version is for the newer ESP32-S3 HeishaMon PCB. You can recognize the 'large' version as the one with optional ethernet support and the two blue relays. The large board is about 10x10cm while the small version is about 4x4cm (without OT) or 4x5cm(with OT).

If you upload the wrong firmware you can brick your HeishaMon and you need to recover it using a USB-TTL cable for the small version and a USB-C cable for the large version.
